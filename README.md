# sql-challenge

This challenge was pretty straightforward although I came to find that setting up a database in pgAdmin 4 is very finicky. I needed to be more certain than I initially was regarding the data types of my columns because using the ALTER query to adjust the tables after the fact was challenging.

I was pretty confident in myself with database querying, but getting used to the error messages from the import/export data option in pgAdmin was a learning opportunity for me.

I put the table structure and queries in the data folder of my repo if you are looking for the work for this. Not much else needs to be said though. I was a little confused about when to use NOT NULL as none of the csv files designated a particular column as required. I opted to go on gut feel for what I would need, although I would say that given how small each table is, I think everything should be required. I tried to just pick the absolute necessities.

As always, the data used for this challenge is not mine, it came to me from the people that run my class and UCBerkeley Bootcamp.
